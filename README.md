# vh41de-auto-trans-controller

Helping out a mate's dad who required an Arduino to control a Nissan VH41DE automatic transmission. The VH41DE has been swapped from a Nissan Cima into a Nissan 240z. The original ECU is no longer being used hence the need for an alternative controller. The engine itself is being controller by a MegaSquirt ECU.

***The idea.... !ADD MORE INFO HERE!***

**TODO**
* Change led outputs to the actually solenoid outputs (used leds for the initial testing process).
* Might add a feature where if the up button is being pressed, if the down button is pressed it will cancel shifting into the next gear.
